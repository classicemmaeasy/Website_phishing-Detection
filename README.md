**Phishing** continues to prove one of the most successful and effective ways for cybercriminals to defraud us and steal our personal and financial information.
Our growing reliance on the internet to conduct much of our day-to-day business has provided fraudsters with the perfect environment to launch targeted phishing attacks.

Website phishing detection is the process of identifying fake or malicious websites that try to trick people into giving away sensitive information, like passwords or credit card numbers.
